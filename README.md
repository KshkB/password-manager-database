# Password manager database

In the `run` folder are Python scripts for creating, updating and searching through an excel file. The fields in the excel file are:

- Website;
- Username;
- Password;
- Further hints.

Run `passwordManager.py` in the main branch and follow the prompts to:

- create a new file;
- update an existing file, by adding a new row entry or updating a password;
- search through an existing file and return results;
- delete an entry in a file.

**Note.** Requires `xlsxwriter`.
